### Starting the Application
To run:    
Make sure everything is built: run *make*    
Start a server: run *./Server*    
    To run on a specific port: run *./Server -p {portNumber}*    
Enter the game with a client: run *./Client*    
    To run on a specific port: run *./Client -p {portNumber}*    
    To run with a specific username: run *./Client -n {username}*    
    You should combine these flags *ie. ./Client -n User1 -p 2001*    
There must be a server running on the port you want to join as a client
